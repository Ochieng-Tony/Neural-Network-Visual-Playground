# Neural-Network-Visual-Playground
This repository contains an interactive **Neural Network Visual Playground** built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.   It provides a hands-on way to understand how neural networks work, how different parameters affect learning, and how visualizations can make concepts in deep learning more intuitive.
