# 🧠 Neural Network Visual Playground

This repository contains an interactive **Neural Network Visual Playground** built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It provides a hands-on way to understand how neural networks work, how different parameters affect learning, and how visualizations can make concepts in deep learning more intuitive.

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive Jupyter Notebook for experimentation
- Visualization of neural network decision boundaries
- Parameter tuning: number of layers, neurons, and activation functions
- Step-by-step explanation of concepts
- Great for students, researchers, and anyone curious about neural networks
